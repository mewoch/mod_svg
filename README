This script takes in svg files and modifies then to allow things like 
QGIS to alter the svg's colour without changing the file, as described
here : http://www.sourcepole.com/svg-symbols-in-qgis-with-modifiable-colors

It does do a few checks on the way through.
1. It expects a file as an option
2. It expects an .svg or .SVG extension
3. It will check for the fill, stroke, and stroke-width parameters and 
   fail if they're not there.
4. It will check if the fill, stroke, and stroke-with parameters have 
   *all* been modified already and fail if they have.

It's a bit rough still so suggestions and improvements are welcome.

Particuarly the fall out from point four needs work. The current
situation is that the script will just add the changes again, leading
to duplication. However, this doesn't seem to cause problems.
As each svg element could (or not) be modified, the script
would need to check each fill, stroke and stroke-with for each element
- and I've not thought that though, without creating lots of temp-stuff.
